# Handwritten-Digit-recognition-
Handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset 

Please change all the "Google drive links in the code with your image path" before execution

This model is trained and tested on the MNIST dataset, I have also tested it on custom images and it gave an accuracy of 90+%.

The libraries used are:

-OpenCV

-Numpy

-Matplotlib

-Tensorflow

If you are executing this code locally then you can simply provide the path of image on your machine, if you're using the online notebook then you can upload all images in your google drive and provide it's path after validating the google drive with your jupyter notebook
